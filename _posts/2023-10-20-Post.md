Recently, I pulled out my 2011 iMac that I've had on my desk for a couple months. I've owned it for 5 years and it previously belonged to an education center in Texas that gave it to me.
I decided to install Mac OS X Mountain Lion on it, still by far one of my favorite operating systems I've tested and used. It was one of the last versions of OS X to look like the original OS X.
