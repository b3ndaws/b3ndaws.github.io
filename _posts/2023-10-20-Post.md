# Installing unsupported versions of macOS / OS X on an iMac

Some Macs say that they don't support versions past ``10.15.6``, ``11.0``, etc. but it's lying. The **OpenCore Legacy Patcher** gives native OTA updates, a smooth experience, and other benefits to using alternative like ``dosdude1`` patchers. As far as my testing has gone, it supports most OS X versions above 10.10.

## The steps in a nutshell
- 1: Download [OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher)
- 2: Use the OpenCore app to download a macOS installer, which also flashes it to a USB
- 3: Install OpenCore on the same USB as your installer
- 4: Plug into the Mac you want to install on, and from there it should be about the same as installing on a supported architecture.

## Step 1: Downloading OpenCore Legacy Patcher
This is the most basic step out of all of them. Download OpenCore from [https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) and just open the app.

## Step 2: Downloading a macOS installer
When you run OpenCore, you should be greeted with a menu like this.

Select **Create macOS Installer**. On the next step, the option you choose varies.

- If you already have a macOS installer you want to use with OpenCore, select **Use existing macOS Installer**.
- If you want to OpenCore to download an installer for you, select **Download macOS Installer**.

OpenCore will compile a list of options that will work for the system. Select the version you want, and click **Download**.

You will see a menu like this where it gives you a progress bar to update you on how far your macOS has downloaded. Wait for it to finish downloading.
